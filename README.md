This repository contains my personal studies and projects as I learn the **Rust programming language**. It serves as a collection of exercises, projects, and notes that document my journey into Rust development.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Rust** – A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

---

## 🌟 Projects and Exercises

- **Guessing Game**: A simple command-line game where the program picks a random number, and the player has to guess it. This project helps in understanding basic I/O operations and control flow in Rust.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RenanDevWeb/estudandoRust.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd estudandoRust
Navigate to the specific project folder (e.g., guessing_game):


cd guessing_game
Run the project using Cargo:
cargo run

📖 Learning Outcomes
Through these exercises and projects, I aim to:

Understand the fundamentals of Rust, including ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

Explore Rust's standard library and ecosystem.

Develop command-line applications using Rust.
